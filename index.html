          back i can imagine myself inhaling the fresh air of Nainital ,<br>
          playing with the sands of the Thar desert , feeling the waves<br>

        <p class="phobby2">Everyday i devote 30 minutes to this activity without failing for<br>
           a single day. In this fast-moving life sometimes we fail to cope <br>
           up with this pace and suffer from anxiety attacks or depressions.<br>
           Even some individuals can make us unhappy. So the best way to tackle<br>
           these things is to devote yourself to practice these asanas or disciplines<br>
           everyday to lead a good and healthy life full of postive thoughts.</p>

                happiness. These enjoyments cannot fulfill our inner bliss,<br>
                they are temporary. We are all parcels of God in this <br>
                short span of time so the only way to achive inner<br>
                bliss is by serving the supreme personality of Godhead.
                By doing so , we can get out of this cycle of birth and<br>
                death and attain the spiritual sky. </h4>

        <h4 class="purpose2ndpara"> After so many years of independence it is pathetic to observe <br>
             that still enoromous number of people are going through the miseries<br>
             of life. By looking at those people it brings saddness back inside me.<br>
             A large amount of people are behind the poverty line , not getting <br>
             adequate amount of food. Rapes have become frequent in India, pending<br>
             justice , agrarian catastrophy for farmers , fake news menace, hate <br>
             speech and false propoganda on social medias , illliteracy , corruption,<br>
             basic sanitation and more. As a citizen of this Nation with great potential<br>
             the purpose of my life will be fulfilled if i can help in eradicating some <br>
             of these problems so that the people suffering out there can live with <br>
             prosperity again. </h4>
